# Analysis-of-Career-Survey

## Overview

This project involves analyzing and visualizing survey data related to career paths in the data industry. The dataset includes responses from individuals detailing their roles, experiences, and preferences in the data field. The analysis aims to provide insights into job satisfaction, career transitions, and industry trends.

## What I Do in This Project

In this project, I focus on the following key tasks:

1. **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning**:
   - **Importing Data**: Load the raw survey data into Power BI.
   - **Cleaning Data**: Address any inconsistencies, missing values, or errors in the dataset.
   - **Transforming Data**: Convert data into a format suitable for analysis (e.g., date/time formats, categorical variables).

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identify patterns, trends, and correlations in the data.
   - **Aggregating Insights**: Summarize findings related to job roles, salaries, satisfaction levels, and career transitions.

3. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - **Designing Visualizations**: Create interactive charts and graphs to represent key metrics such as salary distribution, job satisfaction, and career path transitions.
   - **Building Dashboards**: Develop a Power BI dashboard that integrates various visualizations to provide a clear and actionable view of the data.
     + **Insightful Visualizations**: Users can explore different aspects of the survey data through interactive charts and graphs, making it easier to understand trends and patterns.
     + **Satisfaction Metrics**: By visualizing satisfaction levels related to salary, work/life balance, and other factors, the dashboard provides valuable insights into job satisfaction and areas for improvement.
